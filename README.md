# Studio-project

## Introduction
- For my studio project, I decided to choose ‘Glitches’ because I thought it would be fun to play around in a p5.js sketch. It’s merely focusing on playfulness and randomness, instead of aiming for difficult word coding or perfection. What I really wanted to try is to do the unexpected, and I wanted to lead where it goes wild and crazy into this sketch. 
- During my 10 workshops, there was some uncompleted work due to the past few weeks, but I was quite proud of the final result of what I have done. I was quite a beginner at first, and I was really nervous about studying computer coding for the first lesson but at least there were good experiences. Because of the help from my classmate @emilychen and professor, Leo, I felt very comfortable, and was very helpful from them in the beginning.
- So far, this project, during the concept theme of ‘Glitches’ is where the viewers will experience disorientation & surprise (unexpected shapes and movements) even added to creativity (of what Vera Molnar said “Computers allow artists to establish processes and experiment with the results, rather than sanctifying the output, as if it came from a godly inspiration.” vera molnar's interview. Again, I want to challenge myself on having fun in coding and getting to see the beauty and playfulness, existing in digital and generative art.
